# LC Labs AI Planning Framework



## About 
At a high level, the framework includes three planning phases:  1) Understand 2) Experiment and 3) Implement, which supports the evaluation of three elements of ML: 1) Data; 2) Models; and 3) People. We rely on a set of worksheets, questionnaires, and workshops to engage stakeholders and staff and identify priorities for future exploration. The mechanisms, tools, collaborations, and artifacts together form the AI Planning Framework. Our hope in sharing the framework and associated tools in this initial version is to encourage others to try it out and to solicit additional feedback.  

In planning for and conducting AI and ML experiments at the Library of Congress, we've simplified ML processes into three main elements:  Data, Models, and People. The details of all three elements and how they are put together helps us understand whether an application of this technology is useful, ethical and effective.

A round cylinder icon under Data, under which the following words appear: library content, data readiness, training data, tuning data, validation data, target data, and output data. Top righ a square with four quadrants under which the following words appear: end to end workflow or pipeline, architectures, type of training, libraries utilized, frameworks or platforms. Bottom center a group of four people with arms raised next to which the following words appear: develop use cases, represented in the data, design and sell AI systems, impacted by AI systems, evaluate and implement AI systems.](/images/AI-framework-1.jpg)

Considering the data, models and people involved in an AI system is baked into our AI Planning Framework. The Understand, Experiment and Implement steps include collaborative activities and result in documentation that inform the development of practices and policies for responsible AI. We have yet to move all the way through to the implement stage, but this planning process will build the foundation for a solid and responsible AI strategy based on evidence and Library strengths.

The third reads Implement and depicts a pyramid underneath which are icons of a building with pillars, magnifying glass, people, and a clipboard. At the bottom is a long rectangle reading Governance and Policy.](/images/AI-framework-2.jpg)

## Understand 
Collaboratively articulate principles; assess risks and benefits, map needs, priorities and expertise; learn about data readiness.

| Use Case Risk Worksheet     | This questionnaire is meant to assist staff in assessing the risk profile of an AI use case. The risk level will inform planning for the level of the risk mitigation efforts, estimated timeline for safety, quality and performance verification, and resources required.       | 2023-10-30 | Link to [worksheet](https://git.loc.gov/labs/labs-ai-framework/-/blob/main/Understand/Use_Case_Assessment_Worksheet_2023-10-30-draft.docx). | 
| Phase II Risk Analysis  | Fill out this worksheet to articulate success criteria, measures, risks, and benefits for an AI Use Case. | 2023-10-30 | Link to [worksheet](https://git.loc.gov/labs/labs-ai-framework/-/blob/main/Understand/PhaseII_Risk_Assessement_-_2023-10-30-draft.docx) |

## Experiment 
Test specific use cases, models and data with staff and users to document performance and build quality baselines and benchmarks

## Implement 
AI or ML services are operational and supported by strategy, policies, integrations, shared quality standards and a skilled workforce.
