# LC Labs AI Planning Framework



## About 
LC Labs has been exploring machine learning and artificial intelligence through experiments and research since 2018. Based on these explorations we’ve learned: 

- There is great interest from users, staff, decision-makers, stakeholders, and vendors to use AI to help make progress on entrenched challenges in managing and utilizing LAM data. However, since the technologies are untested for broad use cases both the possibilities and risks are heightened when implementing AI-based tools. A process is needed to consider and assess risks and benefits and to verify stated performance metrics prior to making major investments.  

- The Library can rely on deep experience in digital transformation and existing governance to guide AI implementation. The collaborative creation of quality standards centering the long-term public good and the needs of people—users, communities, staff, and subjects--is how LAMs rode the wave of previous digital transformations. Quality standards, assessment methods and policies that express the values and realities of LAMs must be developed for AI outputs.  

- As was true in previous digital transformations, no one organization can ride the AI wave alone. Subject matter expertise about collections, processes and users continues to be vital but AI and ML skills and positions are rare in LAMs with only the largest and better resourced organizations able to support LAM-specific research and testing for AI.  LAMs of all sizes have relevant skills and knowledge and could use AI to advance their operations. However, under-resourced organizations could be most vulnerable to unfavorable data licensing or sharing agreements or paying for services that do not meet quality standards. There is a need for a network of professionals to share approaches and results from research and experimentation and venues for increasing collaborations, experiences, literacies and skills in ML and AI in LAMs. 

- A large-scale implementation of responsible AI in LAMs is still several years away. The timing is good to increase experimentation and collaboration. LAMs have opportunities to develop the building blocks for an effective, useful, and ethical AI implementation by addressing and understanding current barriers like data bias, quality, privacy and security concerns. Co-developing and communicating our requirements to vendors as a sector will help improve AI outcomes in LAMs, as will sharing information about AI policy, governance, infrastructure and costs.   

To account for these challenges and realities, LC Labs developed mechanisms to build the foundation for a responsible implementation of AI tools in LAM. The process at a very high level is to 1) Understand 2) Experiment and 3) Implement.  While stepping through this process based on previous experience and existing governance, Labs also created a set of worksheets, questionnaires, and workshops to engage stakeholders and staff. The mechanisms, tools, collaborations, and artifacts together form the AI Planning Framework. Labs have yet to move an AI use case through to the implementation phase of the process. But again, the capacities outlined in the final phases are based on experiences in digital transformation, existing requirements for planning, and guidance from sectors that have more mature AI evaluation programs.
